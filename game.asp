<h3>Game</h3>
<p>The game play involves getting to the next level. Each level is only one webpage.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Get to the next level in whichever fashion... but don't use spoilers (answers cracked by other people).</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Look for clickable objects on the page, within text, even within pictures.</li>
  <li>Use Google wherever you think you need it. Most levels anyway require some 
    amount of Googling.</li>
  <li>Some levels require login and passwords to reach them. These are simple 
    words that can be found on any of the levels preceding it, or maybe the result 
    of manipulating something on these levels, or the result of a Google on anything 
    on these levels.</li>
  <li>Look closely at the pictures on the levels, if any, to find clues &amp; 
    hints. But don't be bound by them... some of these pics are there just because 
    we want to show them off :-)</li>
  <li>&quot;May the source be with you&quot;. Answers to some levels may just be hidden 
    in the source code of the webpage itself. Just look at the source of the page 
    to find things that may seem like keys to further levels.</li>
  <li>The way to get to the next level for certain levels after getting the keyword/clue 
    may be to change a word/term in the URL (the http:// thing in the address 
    bar of your browser). Most often than not, it's the last part before the .asp
    (like 'game' for this page).</li>
  <li>Some amount of binary (.exe, .jpg, .mp3) download/manipulation may be required to get 
    the hint to next level.</li>
  <li>Not everything that looks like a hint may point to the right answer/path... we would like to play with your mind once in a while you know :-)</li>
  <li>IMPORTANT: Any text answer required anywhere in the game will always be lowercase, 
    not UPPERCASE, cAmelcase, mIxEdcASe or Sentencecase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!!!<br>
